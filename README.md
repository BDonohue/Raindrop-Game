Section of the Project:
A System that runs the game.
A Class that controls the catcher.
  The Catcher is controlled by the mouse movement.
A Class that controls the score, levels, and lives.
  If the rain goes past the catcher, lives are lost.
  If the rain goes in the catcher, the score is increased.
  If enough points in obtained, a pause screen is placed between levels.
A Class that creates rain.
  If will respond when it goes over the catcher.
  The more the time passes, the more rain will appear.

About:  It's a game where a 
player attempts to catch 
raindrops (circles) from the 
sky.  A player will earn points
for catching them in his/her 
basket, while losing points for
letting balls go past the basket.
After a certain amount of points 
are obtained, a rainbow on the
new screen will appear with a 
button for the next level.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Glitches and Bugs:
The raindrops can enter the basket sideways.
  (It's easier to play though!)
Level 6 is never ending.
  It's possible to add in more levels, but no one has that much attention to play that far.
To get from the intermission (rainbow) screen to the next level, a point is added.
  Look at boolean strt under the Levels tab to see it exactly.
  It was added to make the game simplier, not to give players sympathy points.
