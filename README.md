About:  It's a game where a 
player attempts to catch 
raindrops (circles) from the 
sky.  A player will earn points
for catching them in his/her 
basket, while losing points for
letting balls go past the basket.
After a certain amount of points 
are obtained, a rainbow on the
new screen will appear with a 
button for the next level.
